Hi! I'm Lindia, a PhD student at CMU's [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) advised by [Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/). I am also a frequent visitor at NYU with [Tal Linzen](https://tallinzen.net). I work at the intersection of linguistics, cognitive science, and NLP.

My research largely centers around understanding how models of language learn structure in text (linguistic or otherwise), and how this may allow them to exhibit more complex behaviors. These interests manifest in work across **evaluation** and **interpretability** of large language models, especially with respect to when, where, and how they may be similar or different to humans. I also work on NLP for understudied and endangered languages.

I've previously interned at Apple with the Responsible AI team, working with [Hadas Kotek](https://hkotek.com). Before CMU, I did my undergrad at UT Austin, where I studied linguistics and computer engineering. During my time there, I worked extensively with [John Beavers](https://sites.google.com/a/utexas.edu/jbeavers/). I've also been fortunate enough to have great mentorship from many others, including the amazing [computational linguistics](https://sites.utexas.edu/compling/) faculty there. The summer before my senior year, I was an intern at CMU working with [Shruti Rijhwani](https://shrutirij.github.io/).

In my (precious) free time, I enjoy [painting](https://www.instagram.com/lindiapaints/) (oil and gouache are my mediums of choice), playing the [viola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxFy7Jtsnhc), hanging out with my [cat](https://imgur.com/v012ZEa), running, and reading!
