Hi! I'm Lindia, a third-year PhD student at CMU's [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) advised by [Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/). My current research interests mainly lie (1) the intersection of linguistics (syn+sem+psycholinguistics) and NLP and (2) understanding the impact of data & interaction in language modeling. In addition, I also work on NLP for understudied and endangered languages. I love collaborating with other students and PIs; you're interested in any of the above, feel free to reach out!

I did my undergrad at UT Austin, where I studied linguistics and computer engineering. During my time there, I worked extensively with [John Beavers](https://sites.google.com/a/utexas.edu/jbeavers/) on a project investigating verb class constraints on the English middle construction (e.g. _This car sells well_). I've also been fortunate enough to have great mentorship from many others, including the amazing [computational linguistics](https://sites.utexas.edu/compling/) faculty there. The summer before my senior year, I was an intern at CMU working with [Shruti Rijhwani](https://shrutirij.github.io/) on transfer learning for OCR post-correction of endangered language text.

In my (precious) free time, I enjoy [painting](https://www.instagram.com/lindiapaints/) (oil and gouache are my mediums of choice), playing the [viola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxFy7Jtsnhc), hanging out with my [cat](https://imgur.com/v012ZEa), running, and reading!
