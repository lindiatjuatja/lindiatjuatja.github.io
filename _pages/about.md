Hi! I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at UT Austin where I study Linguistics and Computer Engineering.

I'm applying to PhD programs for the Fall 2022 cycle. My current research interests lie in the intersection of theoretical and computational approaches to semantics & pragmatics, syntax, and linguistic typology. 

Here at UT, I've been working with [John Beavers](https://sites.google.com/a/utexas.edu/jbeavers/) on a project investigating verb class constraints on the English middle construction (e.g. _This car sells well_). Last summer, I was an intern at CMU's [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) where I worked with [Shruti Rijhwani](https://shrutirij.github.io/) and [Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/) on transfer learning for OCR post-correction of [endangered language text](http://www.winlp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/winlp2021_42_Paper.pdf).

In my free time, I enjoy painting (oil and gouache are my mediums of choice), playing the [viola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxFy7Jtsnhc), hanging out with my [cat](https://imgur.com/v012ZEa), and exploring Austin's coffeeshop scene :coffee:
