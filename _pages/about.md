Hi! I'm Lindia, a second-year PhD student at CMU LTI advised by [Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/). I did my undergrad at UT Austin, where I studied linguistics and computer engineering. My current research interests lie in the intersection of theoretical and computational approaches to semantics & pragmatics, syntax, and linguistic typology. I'm also interested in how we can use technologies like large language models as tools to investigate linguistic theories. If you're interested in any of the above, feel free to reach out!

At UT, I've been working with [John Beavers](https://sites.google.com/a/utexas.edu/jbeavers/) on a project investigating verb class constraints on the English middle construction (e.g. _This car sells well_). I've also been fortunate enough to have great mentorship from many others, including the amazing [computational linguistics](https://sites.utexas.edu/compling/) faculty there. The summer before my senior year, I was an intern at CMU's [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) where I worked with [Shruti Rijhwani](https://shrutirij.github.io/) and Graham Neubig on transfer learning for OCR post-correction of endangered language text.

In my (precious) free time, I enjoy painting (oil and gouache are my mediums of choice), playing the [viola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxFy7Jtsnhc), hanging out with my [cat](https://imgur.com/v012ZEa), travelling, and reading!
